<p><small> INFEST 2.0 is simpler, easier-to-use and yet more powerful. So, what are the news exactly? </p>

<li> No more separate menus for each variable type. Now the processed data are found in just one table containing all response variables indicated with their respective prefixes (WDi, NWEi, WDEi). The data table is in the first menu, which was renamed 'Variables/Home'. </li>
<li> Two types of sequential variables are determined: 1) DurFrs_W: duration of first 'W event', and 2) NumPrFrs_W: number of probes to first 'W event', where 'W' represents a generic waveform label. </li>
<li> Modification #1 has made unviable to keep the left side menu to convert seconds to minutes. No big deal! </li>
<li> With modification #2, biplots are made based on the user's selection of the variable type. This is to avoid estimation problems associated with correlation matrix. </li>
<li> The bar-plot submenu: bar-plots can still be displayed for all insects (files) or for a single insect. </li>
<li> Box-plots display jittered raw data. </li>
<li> Multiple comparisons of means: a checkbox allows displaying the results of mean comparisons using 'compact letters'. </li>
<li> The menu 'Sequential events' has been renamed 'Event transitions'. The first submenu stores the usual data table for event transition (from-to) count by insect. A second submenu now displays the transition matrix based on event counts.</li>
<li> Multiple exact binomial tests for evaluating the significance of event transitions. </li>
<li> Best for last! The new menu 'Stats report' allows the user to automatically find and fit the best GAMLSS model, that is, with the lowest AIC, for every response variable in the first menu 'Variables/Home'. Pairwise comparisons of 'Group' means are performed and presented in two ways: contrast tests and with compact letters. Box-plots, plots of confidence interval for 'Group' means and the residual-diagnostic worm-plots are also made. The best? Everithing is brought together in a well organized data analysis report that can be downloaded as an HTML file that can also be converted to a PDF or .doc file. </li>
